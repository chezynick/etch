This is a program I set up as part of the Odin Project, it's a simple online Etch-a-Sketch.
moving the mouse over the canvas will leave a trail of color, the canvas size can be adjusted 
as well as the color the mouse leaves behind.
There is also an additional option which leaves behind a randomly generated color trail.
